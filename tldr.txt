npm install -g unreal-analyzer
```

Configure the analyzer in your AI assistant's settings. For example, in Cline:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unreal-analyzer": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/unreal-analyzer/build/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

2. Basic Usage Examples

a) Analyzing a Character Class
```typescript
// Get detailed information about your custom character class
{
  "name": "analyze_class",
  "arguments": {
    "className": "AMyGameCharacter"
  }
}

// Example Response:
{
  "name": "AMyGameCharacter",
  "baseClass": "ACharacter",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "Health",
      "type": "float",
      "access": "private",
      "metadata": ["UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)"]
    },
    {
      "name": "InventoryComponent",
      "type": "UInventoryComponent*",
      "access": "private",
      "metadata": ["UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)"]
    }
  ],
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "OnHealthChanged",
      "returnType": "void",
      "parameters": ["float NewHealth"],
      "access": "protected",
      "metadata": ["UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)"]
    }
  ]
}
```

b) Finding References
```typescript
// Find all references to a specific function
{
  "name": "find_references",
  "arguments": {
    "identifier": "OnHealthChanged",
    "type": "function",
    "scope": "AMyGameCharacter"
  }
}

// Example Response:
{
  "references": [
    {
      "file": "MyGameCharacter.cpp",
      "line": 45,
      "context": "void AMyGameCharacter::TakeDamage() { OnHealthChanged(Health); }",
      "type": "call"
    },
    {
      "file": "HealthComponent.cpp",
      "line": 89,
      "context": "Character->OnHealthChanged(NewHealth);",
      "type": "call"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Advanced Usage Patterns

a) Analyzing Game Systems
```typescript
// Analyze your game's inventory system
{
  "name": "analyze_subsystem",
  "arguments": {
    "subsystem": "Inventory",
    "includeRelatedClasses": true
  }
}

// Example Response:
{
  "mainClasses": ["UInventoryComponent", "UInventoryItem"],
  "relationships": {
    "UInventoryComponent": {
      "dependencies": ["UInventoryItem", "UItemDatabase"],
      "events": ["OnItemAdded", "OnItemRemoved"]
    }
